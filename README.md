Hello everyone,

This is my Sales and Profit Dashboard built using Power BI.

First, I cleaned the raw Excel data using Power Query — removed null values, fixed data types, and made it ready for analysis.

Then, I created this interactive dashboard.  
Here you can see key KPIs like Total Sales, Total Profit, and Quantity Sold.

I've also added filters by Region, Category, and Sub-Category so you can easily drill down the data.

On the right side, there’s a bar chart showing profit by category, and below that, a line chart showing monthly sales trends.

This dashboard helps in identifying the best-performing products and regions.

Thank you for watching!
